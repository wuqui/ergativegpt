# Task

As a corpus linguistic annotator for a linguistic research project, your job is to analyze sentences from a web corpus. You will be presented with an attestation of a verb and its context in the corpus (e.g. "'was uploading' in: 'He was uploading the files'".) and you have to analyze the usage of this verb in its immediate clause context according to several variables.

## Variables

### Part of Speech 

**Task**: Identify whether the attestation is a verb or not. Label it `verb` or `other`.

**Definitions**:

- `verb`: A verb indicates the occurrence or performance of an action or the existence of a state or condition. 
- `other`: Any other part of speech such as an adjective or a noun. An adjective designates an attribute and qualifies a noun to describe it more fully. A noun designates a person, place or thing.

**Examples**:

- `verb`: "'was opened' in: 'The door was opened.'" (Label as `verb`; "was opened" is a verb and indicates the occurrence of an action.)
- `verb`: "'closed' in: 'He closed the door.'" (Label as `verb`; "closed" is a verb and indicates the performance of an action.)
- `verb`: "'closed up' in: 'The bank closed up one of its branches.'" (Label as `verb`; "closed up" is a verb and indicates the performance of an action.)
- `other`: "'open' in: 'The door is open.'" (Label as `other`; "open" is an adjective and designates an attribute of the door.)
- `other`: "'closed' in: 'The door was closed.'" (Label as `other`; "closed" is ambiguous between a passive, which indicates the occurrence of an action and an adjective, which designates an attribute of the door.)
- `other`: "'close up' in: 'They filmed a close up.'" (Label as `other`; "close up" is a noun and designates a thing.)
- `other`: "'splitting' in: 'He had a splitting headache.'" (Label as `other`; "splitting" is an adjective and designates an attribute of the headache.)

### Subject Animacy

**Task**: Identify whether the subject of the verb is `animate` or `inanimate`.

**Definitions**:

- `animate` subjects are living entities, typically people or animals, or organisations and geographical entities referring to groups of people. 
- `inanimate` subjects are non-living entities, such as objects or concepts.

**Examples**:

- `animate`: "'barked' in: 'The dog barked loudly.'" (Label as `animate`; the subject of "barked" is "the dog" and it is a living entity.)
- `animate`: "'released' in: 'Microsoft released a new software version.'" (Label as `animate`; the subject of "released" is "Microsoft" and it is an organisation that consists of a group of people.)
- `animate`: "'installed' in: 'The city of Munich installed new park benches.'" (Label as `animate`; the subject of "installed" is "the city of Munich" and it is a geographical entity that refers to a local community of people.)
- `inanimate`: "'struck' in: 'The clock struck midnight.'" (Label as `inanimate`; the subject of "struck" is "the clock" and it is a non-living object.)
- `inanimate`: "'left' in: 'Her vanity left her heavily in debt.'" (Label as `inanimate`; the subject of "left" is "her vanity" and it is an abstract concept.)
- `inanimate`: "'to install' in: 'Microsoft is easy to install.'" (Label as `inanimate`; the subject of "to install" is "Microsoft" and it is a software program and a non-living entity.)

### Subject Role

**Task**: Analyse the semantic role of the subject of the target verb.

**Definitions**: 

- `agent`: The subject of the verb performs or causes the action. It is typically a doer or a causative entity in the sentence.
- `patient`: The subject of the verb undergoes the action. It is usually the entity that is acted upon or affected by the action.

**Examples**:

- `agent`: "'chased' in: 'The cat chased the mouse.'" (Label as `agent`; the subject of "chased" is "the cat" and it is performing the action of chasing.)
- `agent`: "'is uploading' in: 'The girl is uploading to the platform daily.'" (Label as `agent`; the subject of "is uploading" is "the girl" and she is performing the action of uploading.)
- `agent`: "'will download' in: 'Your phone will download installed apps automatically.'" (Label as `agent`; the subject of "will download" is "your phone" and it is performing the action of downloading.)
- `patient`: "'was chased' in: 'The mouse was chased by the cat.'" (Label as `patient`; the subject of "was chased" is "the mouse" and it is undergoing the action of being chased.)
- `patient`: "'is filming' in: 'The movie is currently filming in Prague.'" (Label as `patient`; the subject of "is filming" is "the movie" and it is undergoing the action of being filmed.)
- `patient`: "'will download' in: 'The game will download automatically.'" (Label as `patient`; the subject of "will download" is "the game" and it is undergoing the action of being downloaded.)

### Transitivity

**Task**: Determine whether this use of the verb is `transitive` or `intransitive`. 

**Definitions**:

- `transitive` verbs directly act on a noun phrase that has the syntactic role of an explicit direct object in the clause.
- `intransitive` verbs do not act on a noun phrase, or there is no noun phrase explicitly stated as being acted upon in the sentence; this also applies to verbs that have a prepositional object but no direct syntactical object.

**Examples**:

- `transitive`: "'approved' in: 'The committee approved the new policy.'" (Label as `transitive`; "the new policy" is the direct object of "approved".)
- `transitive`: "'are uploading' in: 'Many teachers are uploading their classes online." (Label as `transitive`; "their classes" is the direct object of "are uploading".)
- `transitive`: "'to improve' in: 'She was anxious to improve herself.'" (Label as `transitive`; "herself" is the direct object of "to improve".)
- `intransitive`: "'was approved' in: 'The new policy was approved.'" (Label as `intransitive`; no direct object for "was approved".)
- `intransitive`: "'are uploading' in: 'Many users are uploading to the platform daily.'" (Label as `intransitive`; no direct object for "are uploading".)
- `intransitive`: "'will screen' in: 'The movie will screen at the film festival.'" (Label as `intransitive`; no direct object for "will screen".)

### Causativity

**Task**: Determine whether this use of the verb is `causative` or `anticausative`. 

**Definitions**:

- `causative` verbs indicate that one person or thing causes another person or thing to do something, or causes a change in state. They have an explicit or implied agent who performs or causes the action. Passive constructions are causative, because the passive implies an agent.
- `anticausative` verbs indicate that a person or thing undergoes a change of state without an explicit or implied agent or cause. 

**Examples**:

- `causative`: "'opened' in: 'She opened the door.'" (Label as `causative`; "opened" has an explicit agent, "she", who caused the door to open.)
- `causative`: "'open' in: 'Open the door!'" (Label as `causative`; "open" is an imperative and implies an agent, who will cause the door to open.)
- `causative`: "'were uploaded' in: 'The images were uploaded.'" (Label as `causative`; "were uploaded" is passive and implies an agent, who caused the images to upload.)
- `causative`: "'to be aired' in: 'The show is to be aired.'" (Label as `causative`; "to be aired" is a non-finite passive and implies an agent, who will cause the show to air.)
- `causative`: "'to improve' in: 'He will try to improve.'" (Label as `causative`; "to improve" has an explicit agent "he", who will act on himself to improve.)
- `anticausative`: "'opened' in: 'The door opened.'" (Label as `anticausative`; "opened" indicates a change of state of the subject "the door" without an explicit or implied agent or cause.)
- `anticausative`: "'aired' in: 'The show first aired in 1993.'" (Label as `anticausative`; "aired" indicates a change of state of the subject "the show" without an explicit or implied agent or cause.)
- `anticausative`: "'are uploading' in: 'The images are uploading.'" (Label as `anticausative`; "are uploading" indicates a change of state of the subject "the images" without an explicit or implied agent or cause.)
- `anticausative`: "'to dry' in: 'How long does the paint need to dry?" (Label as `anticausative`; "to dry" indicates a change of state of the subject "the paint" without an explicit or implied agent or cause.)
- `anticausative`: "'was improving' in: 'The doctor claimed that he was improving rapidly.'" (Label as `anticausative`; "was improving" indicates a change of state of the subject "he" without an explicit or implied agent or cause.)
