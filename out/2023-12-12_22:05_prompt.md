# Task

As a corpus linguistic annotator for a linguistic research project, your job is to analyze utterances from a web corpus according to several variables. Understanding these variables is crucial for deeper linguistic analysis and understanding of language use.

## Variables

### Transitivity

**Definition**: Determine whether the utterance contains a clause with an `intransitive` verb. 

- **Transitive verbs** directly act on a noun that is clearly stated in the sentence.
- **Intransitive verbs** do not act on a noun, or there is no noun explicitly stated as being acted upon in the sentence.
- Verbs with prepositional objects but no direct object are considered `intransitive`.
- As soon as there is at least one intransitive verb in the utterance, label the whole utterance as `intransitive`.

**Examples**:

- Transitive: "The committee approved the new policy." (Label as `transitive` since "the new policy" is the direct object of "approved".)
- Intransitive: "The athletes competed fiercely in the tournament." (Label as `intransitive`; no direct object for "competed".)


### Causativity

**Definition**: Determine whether the sentence contains an anticausative verb.

- **Anticausative verbs** describe an action that occurs without a clear, deliberate agent.
- These verbs often appear in intransitive forms where the subject is the recipient of the action rather than the doer.
- As soon as there is at least one anticausative verb in the utterance, label the whole utterance as `anticausative`.

**Examples**:

- Anticausative: "The door opened." (Label as `anticausative`; "opened" is anticausative, implying action without a clear agent.)
- Causative: "She opened the door." (Label as `causative`; "opened" has a clear agent, "She".)


### Subject Animacy

**Definition**: Identify whether the subject of the sentence is animate or inanimate.

- **Animate subjects** are living entities, typically people or animals.
- **Inanimate subjects** are non-living entities, such as objects or concepts.
- If the sentence contains more than one subject, analyse the animacy of the subject of the verb that is potentially intransitive or anticausative.

**Examples**:

- Animate: "The dog barked loudly." (Label as `animate`; "The dog" is a living entity.)
- Inanimate: "The clock struck midnight." (Label as `inanimate`; "The clock" is a non-living object.)


### Subject Role

**Definition**: Determine the semantic role of the subject in the utterance as either an `agent` or a `patient`.

- **Agent**: The subject performs the action. It is typically a doer or a causative entity in the sentence.
- **Patient**: The subject receives the action. It is usually the entity that is acted upon or affected by the action.

**Examples**:

- Agent: "The cat chased the mouse." (Label as `agent`; "The cat" is performing the action of chasing.)
- Patient: "The mouse was chased by the cat." (Label as `patient`; "The mouse" is receiving the action of being chased.)
